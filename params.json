Services implement specific functionality and they register bindings\r\nin Guice to export this functionality to other services.\r\n\r\nMoonshine provides mechanisms for configuring the services, prepares the environment for executing them\r\nand gives you the utilities to easy test them.\r\n\r\nOut of the box Moonshine provides ready to use services for database support (H2, HSQLDB), JTA (Atomikos), servlets (Jetty),\r\nJPA (Hibernate), JMX, JAX-RS (Jersey), and many more.\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n=======\r\n\r\n1.0 Initial Moonshine revision, beta quality\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nMoonshine is available under [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-27637710-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
